    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        250g paneer (Indian cottage cheese), cut into cubes
        1 medium bell pepper (capsicum), cut into chunks
        1 medium onion, cut into chunks
        8-10 cherry tomatoes
        1/2 cup hung curd (strained yogurt)
        1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
        1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
        1 teaspoon red chili powder
        1 teaspoon garam masala
        1 tablespoon lemon juice
        Salt to taste
        Skewers for grilling
    </ul>

    <h3>Spices:</h3>
    <ul>
        1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
        1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
        A pinch of chaat masala (optional)
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine hung curd (strained yogurt), ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add cubed paneer, bell peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes to the marinade. Gently coat the paneer and vegetables with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 1-2 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill or oven to medium-high heat. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Thread the marinated paneer and vegetables onto the skewers. You can alternate between paneer, bell peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Grill the paneer skewers for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the paneer and vegetables are lightly charred and cooked through. If using the oven, place the skewers on a baking tray and bake at 200°C (390°F) for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the paneer tikka from the skewers and serve hot with mint chutney and lemon wedges. Enjoy this delicious appetizer with your family and friends!</li>
