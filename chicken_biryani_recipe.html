      <li>500 grams chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fried onions (optional, for garnish)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves), for garnish</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped mint leaves, for garnish</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>A pinch of saffron strands (soaked in warm milk)</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3>Spices:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>3-4 green cardamom pods</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon biryani masala powder (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, and cumin seeds) and sauté for a minute until they release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook the masala until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chicken pieces and cook for about 5-7 minutes until they are partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and mix in the yogurt, biryani masala (if using), half of the chopped mint leaves, and half of the chopped cilantro. Cover the pot and let the chicken cook in the yogurt and spices for another 10-15 minutes until it becomes tender and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>In a separate large pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice and cook until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked chicken in the pot. Sprinkle the remaining chopped mint leaves and cilantro on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the saffron-soaked milk over the rice for a beautiful color and aroma.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Once the Chicken Biryani is done, gently fluff the rice with a fork. Garnish with fried onions (if using).</li>
        <li>Serve the aromatic and flavorful Chicken Biryani hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad. Enjoy this traditional and mouth-watering dish with your family and friends!</li>
