    <h2>Gulab Jamun Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        1 cup milk powder
        1/4 cup all-purpose flour
        A pinch of baking soda
        1 tablespoon ghee
        1/4 cup milk (approximately)
        Oil or ghee for frying
    </ul>

    <h3>For Syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
        1 cup sugar
        1 cup water
        A few cardamom pods or rose water for flavor
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and a pinch of baking soda.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the ghee and milk to form a smooth dough. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry. If needed, add more milk or ghee as required.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in water and bringing it to a boil. Add a few cardamom pods or rose water to enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls and roll them between your palms to make smooth balls. Make sure there are no cracks in the balls.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat. Fry the gulab jamun balls in batches until they turn golden brown and are fully cooked from inside.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried gulab jamuns and immediately drop them into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the sweetness.</li>
        <li>Serve the soft and spongy Gulab Jamuns warm or at room temperature. Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds if desired. Enjoy this delectable Indian dessert!</li>
