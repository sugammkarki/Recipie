    <h2>Vegetable Biryani Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        

2 cups Basmati rice
2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, potatoes, etc.), chopped
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
Salt to taste
Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (for garnish)
     
    </ul>

    <h3>Spices:</h3>
    <ul>
    1-inch cinnamon stick
2-3 green cardamom pods
4-5 whole cloves
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon biryani masala (optional)
</ul>
    
    

    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, and cumin seeds) and sauté for a minute until they release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook the masala until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chopped vegetables and cook for about 5-7 minutes until they are partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and mix in the yogurt, biryani masala (if using), half of the chopped mint leaves, and half of the chopped cilantro. Cover the pot and let the vegetables cook in the yogurt and spices for another 10-15 minutes until they are tender and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>In a separate large pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice and cook until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked vegetables in the pot. Sprinkle the remaining chopped mint leaves and cilantro on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the saffron-soaked milk over the rice for a beautiful color and aroma.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Once the Vegetable Biryani is done, gently fluff the rice with a fork. Serve this aromatic and flavorful dish hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad.</li>
      </ol>
